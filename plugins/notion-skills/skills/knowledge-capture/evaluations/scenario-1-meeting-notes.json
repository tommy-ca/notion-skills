    "content": "Had a meeting today with product, engineering, and design about Q4 priorities. We talked about the fact that customers have been asking for dark mode for a while - it's our most requested feature. Sarah (PM) said we should prioritize it, and Mike (design) showed mockups that look great. The engineering team (me, Alex, and Jordan) think we can get it done in 2 sprints if we focus. We also talked about the mobile app - James mentioned that iOS performance is slow when rendering large lists. We didn't decide on a timeline for that yet. Alex volunteered to look into virtualization. For dark mode, we decided to ship it with a toggle in settings that persists to the database. Next steps: Sarah will write the spec this week, Mike will finalize designs by end of week, and our team will start on implementation next sprint. We also have some tech debt from the old auth system that Mike thinks is slowing us down, but we deferred that to next quarter. Finally, we need a QA plan for dark mode - Jessica said she'd put together a testing plan."
