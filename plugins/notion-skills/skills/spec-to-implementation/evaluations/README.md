# Spec-to-Implementation - Evaluation Scenarios

Test scenarios for validating specification parsing and implementation plan generation.

## Evaluation Criteria

**Requirement Extraction**
- All functional requirements identified
- Non-functional requirements documented
- Acceptance criteria captured
- Dependencies clearly stated

**Task Breakdown**
- Specifications decomposed into atomic tasks
- Task sizing appropriate (1-2 days each)
- Technical dependencies mapped
- Parallel work opportunities identified

**Estimation**
- Effort estimates realistic
- Timeline achieves project goals
- Buffer time included for unknowns
- Risk factors considered

**Tracking**
- Implementation plan is actionable
- Progress metrics are trackable
- Milestones clearly defined
- Links to specification maintained

## Test Scenario Types

1. **Feature Implementation** - New feature specification to implementation plan
2. **API Development** - API specification with endpoint breakdown
3. **System Migration** - Migration specification with phased approach
4. **Product Launch** - Multi-component launch planning
5. **Infrastructure Project** - Technical infrastructure setup

## Success Indicators

✓ All requirements addressed in task list
✓ Tasks are specific and actionable
✓ Timeline is realistic
✓ Dependencies are clear
✓ Implementation is trackable
✓ Risks identified and mitigation planned
